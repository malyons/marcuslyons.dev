I participated in the March cohort of
[Ship 30 for 30](https://enroll.ship30for30.com/a/40xtn) and had some doubts at
the beginning that I'd even be able to post for 30 days.

Doubts like:

- What to write
- Why I'm writing
- How I'll find time

While I didn't follow _all_ of the course guidelines, I learned from this
experience and will definitely keep writing daily.

## Topics

I had a hard time coming up with things to write about in the beginning. The
brainstorming session gave insight into the problem. It's not that we don't have
anything to write. We have too much to write about.

### What problems have you solved over the last 2 years?

The exercise centers around answering ðŸ‘† and if you're like me, you had a page
full of things you'd solved, learned, or accomplished over the last few years.

We take the list and put them into categories, trying to find at least 2 or 3
that sounds the most exciting to you.

We can take those categories and come up with some headlines that could help you
2 years ago. For me, that could look like

- Getting started with Svelte
- How to set up your LinkedIn for getting a remote software development job
- React vs. Svelte, which is better for beginners?

## Perfectionism

I have a hard time with perfectionism, and it has caused me to not take action
on things I want to do in the past, but I set out with the goal of actually
shipping 30 atomic essays.

I'm not the best writer, but as Austin Kleon explains in this article,
[quantity leads to quality](https://austinkleon.com/2020/12/10/quantity-leads-to-quality-the-origin-of-a-parable/).

## Consistency

If there's a piece of advice, I've heard more than anything, being consistent
outweighs most other things when it comes to accomplishing your goals.

When it comes to being consistent, I'm consistently inconsistent. Having ADHD, I
find it easy to hyper-fixate on something interesting, but that dopamine isn't
there after a while. This makes it hard to do what I want to do, but I've
learned ways to deal with it.

The last 30 days and Ship 30 have been beneficial to me.

I've successfully shipped 30 articles (I still need to transition everything
here), learned that writing helps me think more clearly, and have ideas on how
to keep this going.
