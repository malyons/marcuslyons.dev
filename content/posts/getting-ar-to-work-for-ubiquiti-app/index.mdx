I added a new switch a while back to my home lab rack and haven't been able to
get the AR feature of the Unify Network app to work.

To get it to work after you've already set up a rack within the app you need to
delete the rack and add each item individually by scanning the AR image on the
touchscreens.

To delete the rack you need to:

- Enter AR Mode
- Press the three dots in the top right corner `...`
- Select delete rack

You should be able to then create a new rack in the AR section which will prompt
you to scan each item in your rack, starting from the top.

Once this is done you'll be able to see all of your equipment and switch between
them in the AR mode.
