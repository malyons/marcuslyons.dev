Syncing a local git repository fork with the upstream main repo.

* In the working directory of the repository
* Fetch branches and commits from upstream repo.
  * eg. `git fetch upstream`
* Check out the fork's local default branch ie `main`
  * `git checkout main`
* Merge the changes from the upstream default branch ie `upstream/main`
  * `git merge upstream/main`

> 📝 Note: this only syncs the local copy of the repo, you still have to push to remote if you want to update the repo in VCS
