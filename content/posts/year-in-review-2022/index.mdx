That time of year again, but the first I've actually put one of these together
and I was surprised at some of what I remembered.

The saying goes "The days are long but the years are short", and it's true. This
year, like most, feels like it flew by, and when first thinking about what
happened this year there wasn't a lot that came to mind. The more I thought
though, the more great, and not so great, memories came up.
