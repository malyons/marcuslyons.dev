> **TLDR:** > _System Preferences_ > _Mission Control_ > _Displays have separate Spaces_ must be checked

Recently I found myself trying to keep my resource usage down on an old Mac Mini and MacBook Pro. Trying to run all the things I’m used to on a more performant machine limited me in what I was doing. Fun fact, on this machine, running Outlook and Skype at the same time causes it to completely freeze and be unresponsive during a video call.

In order to set things up for multiple displays and workspaces you need to go into _System Preferences_ and select _Mission Control_.

Make sure that _Displays have separate Spaces_ is selected. If not, select it after which you’ll need to Log Out in order for this setting to take effect.

Now you’ll be able to have more than one _Main Space_ across displays. No longer will your extra desktops be across all displays either.
