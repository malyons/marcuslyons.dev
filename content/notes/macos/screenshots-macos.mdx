# Screenshots MacOS

---

To take a screenshot you use:

> CMD + SHIFT + 4

This will turn your mouse into little crosshairs and let you drag to select the correct sized screenshot, saved to desktop by default.

To take a screenshot of a window (with a sweet drop shadow), without dragging or any of that:

> CMD + SHIFT + 4
> Then press
> SPACE

Adding `CTRL` to any of the above commands will save it to the clipboard instead of desktop (or wherever you set MacOS to save screenshots to)
