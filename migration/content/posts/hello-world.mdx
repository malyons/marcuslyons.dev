It seems appropriate to not only start this today, but to use this title. Since
my son Mason has said his own “Hello, world!” today. Being a newborn, he can’t
speak yet but he’s at the beginning of his journey. Much like we all were at one
point or another, and with each new thing we learn, continue that journey into a
new realm.

I remember writing my first program as a kid, and by program it was “Hello,
world!” printed to the screen. (Likely followed shortly after by something
crude). It was gratifying to make that happen, even though looking back it was
trivial compared to what I’ve done since. My original goal was to create games,
and I did for a bit. I’m still upset with myself that I didn’t keep copies of
those text adventure games. As terrible as they were it would have been great to
go back and look them over now. A benchmark of a much younger me, a stranger at
this point.

My plan for this site is to write about what I’m building, what and how I’m
learning as I go. A reflective look at things, and a way to help others if they
stumble upon a post.
