What project doesn't need to include text? I have a hard time coming up with the
right copy for a side project, or just something I'm testing out in a prototype.
Not having to wait for "the right words" to flow, or waiting on someone from
marketing can increase the speed at which you develop your applications, and
allow you to find out what works and doesn't. You can use a generator to create
whatever text you want to, and while the Lorem Ipsum generator has been around
for some time, maybe you'd like to try something else out.

I've compiled a list of fun, and some **NSFW** (not safe for work), Lorem Ipsum
generator alternatives to use.
