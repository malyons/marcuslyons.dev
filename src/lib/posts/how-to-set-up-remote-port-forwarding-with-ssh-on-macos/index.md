Sometimes we want to run a process, or container, on another machine but access
it locally.

Remote Port Forwarding, or tunneling, can help with precisely this. It allows us
to start a process on another machine but bind a port on that remote to one on
our computer. We could run a Fastify server and bind our local port to a remote
port. We would then be able to access that server on our local port.

Unfortunately, this isn't something super commonly taught these days.

To set this up, we need to run:

> `ssh -R 3000:3000 user@host`

What's happening in the previous command is:

- Connecting to a remote machine at user@host
  - User being the username
  - Host being the remote machines IP (local or remote network)
- -R to state Remote forwarding
- 3000:3000 is binding port 3000 on the local machine to port 3000 on the remote
  <local:remote>

With the increased bandwidth and internet speeds offered in many areas. The need
to have a beast of a local machine is starting to lessen. This opens the door to
building apps and sites on iPads, and other devices. Typically considered
underpowered and not set up for actual development.

With this tool, you'll be able to use another machine to run your apps, servers,
and projects. Freeing up local resources for all the Chrome tabs your system can
handle.
