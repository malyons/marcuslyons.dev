When learning to write in school, most of us were taught that a process must be
followed to be considered finished.

Start with a rough draft, then edits on the way to a final draft, refining the
paper as you go until the final draft barely resembles the rough draft. All of
this is being done before it's turned in, not iteratively when new information
is learned. This process-heavy writing isn't reflective of how the real world
works; information is constantly changing. It's rarely in a "final" state.

In the garden metaphor, we find a plot of land where we cultivate plants of all
types, tending to their needs and guiding them in their lives. We tend to them
and help them grow. We can similarly think of our writing. **Our notes start no
different than seedlings**, developed from that seed of an idea, and over time
we refine and add to it to grow into an evergreen tree.

Following this cycle, we can break free from the idea that we must strive for
perfection, that we can't put anything out into the world without it being
perfect in every way. That way of thinking will only prevent us from putting
anything out in public. **Iteration is the name of the game in software**. Why
can't that be the same for our writing?
