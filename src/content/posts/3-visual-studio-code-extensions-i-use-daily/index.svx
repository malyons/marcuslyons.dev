## Advanced New File

The default experience of creating an untitled file in the root of the workspace
when you want to make a new file from the keyboard shortcut in VS Code isn't
ideal.

`advanced-new-file` dramatically expands the capabilities of VS Code by giving
you a command prompt on new file creation that allows you to specify _where_ the
file will be located. It also gives you the ability to **create new folders**,
**nest the new file** in said new folder, or even **generate the file in another
directory** entirely.

## Easy Snippet

I've used a variety of text expansion snippets for years with things like
addresses, phone numbers, names, and email.

When I worked in customer support, snippets were a lifesaver for responding to
chat and email requests. We can do the same with code using Easy Snippet. This
extension **helps with managing and creating snippets**.

My favorite part is being able to highlight a section of code or even an entire
file and **generate a snippet from that selection**. Allowing you to skip the
boilerplate and get right into the fun parts of coding.

## Thunder Client

Sometimes you need to test an API endpoint or develop an API route, and you want
to see what it's returning as you go.

If you don't want to run a separate app to make requests or use the browser, you
can use an extension like Thunder Client. This **brings a Postman-like
experience into your editor**, giving you the option to have code side by side
with your API client.
