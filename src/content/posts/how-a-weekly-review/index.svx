A weekly review is, in name, a simple task, but the difficulty lies in one's
ability to conduct it.

As someone with ADHD, that consistency part is... challenging to say the least.
I first learned about a weekly review some years ago, and I've conducted less
than twenty since.

I like to think of it as a mix between an After Action Review from the military,
and a Sprint Retro, from Agile.

Unfortunately, what seems simple can be challenging to keep up with.

The weeks seem to blend together after a time. Doing this over the last month
has allowed me to identify ways to improve.

## My Process

- Create a weekly review doc in Obsidian

- Review the week in the bullet journal and correlate items with daily notes in
  Obsidian

- Move anything of note to the weekly review doc

- Move anything of note to the Brag Doc

- Reflect on the distractions sections of the daily notes and bullet journal

### Reflection and Planning

There wouldn't be much of a point to the review if it wasn't something you could
use to change your trajectory.

Throughout the week, I'll write down what distracts me. During the weekly review
I will attempt to identify a solution for the following week.

This could mean:

- Blocking time on the calendar

- Closing Slack and setting Do Not Disturb on my devices

- Leaving my phone in another room.

Regardless of the issue, being able to identify and improve, even by a tiny
amount, means growth towards what I truly want to be doing. Not wasting time on
things I shouldn't.
